                          Bootrap classes for headings:

h1 : display-1
h2 : display-2
h3 : display-3
h4 : display-4
h5 : display-5
h6 : display-6

To increase the line height and font size of the paragraph we use a class with p tag that is

.lead (lead class)

To remove the formating from the list, we use the list-unstyled class
.list-unstyled

As the list is the block element but if we want that all the elements of list should be display in one line then we have to use two classes
.list-inline  ( in <ul> tag)
.list-inline-item ( in <li> tag)
