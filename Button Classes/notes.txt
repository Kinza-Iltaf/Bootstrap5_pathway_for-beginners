              For buttons:

for button we use a btn class with predefined colors

.btn-colorname : like primary , secondary , success , danger , info , dark etc
 We use also button tags for creating any button.

 < button btn btn-primary type = " submit" > Submit < /button>

                outline buttons classes:

.btn-outline-primary


                         Button size classes

btn-lg  (large)
btn-sm  (small)

To give the button full width equal to screen size then we use div and inside that div we use the class d-grid and if we have multiple buttons just above at each other then we want that there should be gap between them so for this puopose we use gap-any number(from 1 to 5)

d-grid gap-2 (inside the div tag and the 2 unit gap in be generated)



                         Active and disabled classes

for disabled button we use .disabled class
for active button we use .active class
