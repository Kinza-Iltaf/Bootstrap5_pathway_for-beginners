                   button group:

making multiple button together with no space between them. so for this purpose we use a class in parent div
.btn-group (in parent div and the rest would be same like btn class and its color etc)    


                        changing the size of button

for this we use the classes
btn-group-lg (large)
btn-group-sm   (small)     


                         Making the button vertical

btn-group-vertical (convert the group from horizontal to vertical)
